# âœ… VSM Metrics System - Working Confirmation

## Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

The VSM Metrics system has been successfully implemented and tested. All core components are working:

### Confirmed Working Components:

1. **Shannon Entropy Calculator** âœ…
   - Correctly calculates entropy for distributions
   - Binary entropy: 1.0 for 50/50 distribution
   - Uniform entropy: 2.0 for 4 equal probabilities

2. **Variety Engineering (Ashby's Law)** âœ…
   - Requisite variety calculations work correctly
   - Controller vs Environment variety comparison
   - Properly identifies variety deficits

3. **VSM Time Constants** âœ…
   - All 5 subsystems have appropriate time constants
   - S3 Control: 60s response time, 3600s decay
   - Temporal dynamics calculations functional

4. **CRDT Aggregation** âœ…
   - G-Counter increments correctly (tested: 10 + 5 = 15)
   - Distributed aggregation without conflicts
   - Merge operations preserve data

5. **Multi-tier Storage** âœ…
   - Memory tier with sub-millisecond access
   - ETS warm tier operational
   - DETS cold tier with compression
   - Proper data retrieval across tiers

6. **Core VSM Metrics** âœ…
   - Subsystem health calculations
   - Variety entropy measurements
   - Response time tracking
   - Algedonic signal handling

### How to Run:

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/jmanhype/vsm-metrics.git
cd vsm-metrics
mix deps.get

# Compile
mix compile

# Run tests
mix run simple_test.exs

# Interactive shell
iex -S mix

# In IEx:
VsmMetrics.entropy(%{a: 0.5, b: 0.5})
VsmMetrics.record(:s3, :operation, "test")
VsmMetrics.health(:s3)
```
