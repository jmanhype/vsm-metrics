## 2. Variety Engineering Metrics (Ashby's Law)

### 2.1 Core Principle
"Only variety can destroy variety" - The system must have requisite variety to match environmental complexity.

### 2.2 Key Metrics

**Variety Measurement**:
```elixir
variety = shannon_entropy(state_distribution)
```

```elixir
ratio = controller_variety / controlled_variety
# Optimal: ratio >= 1.0
```

- Complexity index calculation

### 2.3 Variety Management Strategies

**Amplification** (when ratio < 1.0):

- Add control channels
- Enhance sensing capabilities

**Attenuation** (when ratio > 1.0):
- Filter noise
- Aggregate similar states
- Focus on critical signals

## 3. Shannon Entropy Calculations

### 3.1 Basic Formula
```
H(X) = -Σ p(xi) * log2(p(xi))
```

### 3.2 Implementation Patterns

**State Entropy** (from vsm-core):
```elixir
def shannon_entropy(probabilities) do
  probabilities
  |> Enum.filter(&(&1 > 0))
  |> Enum.reduce(0, fn p, acc ->
    acc - p * :math.log2(p)
  end)
end
```

**Temporal Variety Entropy**:
- Real-time entropy calculation
- Multi-timescale aggregation
- Confidence scoring based on sample size

### 3.3 Entropy Applications

### 4.2 Decay Functions

**Exponential Decay** (from pattern engine):

# y = a * exp(-b * x)
decay_rate = -slope
half_life = :math.log(2) / decay_rate
```

**Applications**:
